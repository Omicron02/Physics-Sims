## Sim 1: Double_Pendulum.py
Allows the user to visualize the motions of a double pendulum and modify their properties as well.
The user can modify mass, length of pendulum as well the angle of the pendulum for both the bobs.
There are 2 graphs, one of which shows the change in angle of the 2 bobs wrt time and the other graph shows the change in the angle of the 2nd bob wrt the angle of the 1st bob.

## Sim 2: Electric.py
Shows the motion of 2 particles with +ve and -ve charge in electric and magnetic fields.
The yellow region represents the electric field and the blue region represents the magnetic field. The direction of the arrow signifies the direction of the field.

## Sim 3: Grav.py
Shows a basic orbit structure with the arrows representing the force of gravity being experienced by the orbiting object.

### Right clicking and dragging allows you to view the simulation from different angles.
